            The Congregation of Holy Trinity is a charitable organization,
            governed by its entire membership through a democratic vote at a
            general meeting. The Diocese as ecclesiastical guide and authority
            provides us with canonical administration. The church raises

            for priestly services, candle sales, the annual bazaar, calendar
            sales, group festivities and holidays. The church offers for rent
            the newly renovated church hall for private events and cultural
            activities.

      <p className="about__text">
        Holy Trinity Macedonian-Bulgarian Eastern Orthodox Church was founded on
        October 22, 1973 and was placed under the protection of the Russian
        Church in Exile. Father Vassil Mihailoff was the parish priest of Holy
        Trinity until his death in 1981. He was beloved and respected by all in
        the parish. There were approximately 300 founding members. On November
        30, 1973 the Holy Trinity Religious and Educational Centre Trust
        Foundation was established. It started with zero financial capital and
        quickly collected forty-six thousand dollars in donations from devoted
        parishioners. The Declaration of Trust defines the objects of the trust
        in these terms:

        In 1976 the Anglican church of the Holy Nativity on 201 Monarch Park
        Avenue was purchased for $350K with most of the money donated by the
        parishioners. A significant part (around $40K) came from selling a
        previously bought property on Warden Avenue. The church was consecrated
        as Holy Trinity.

        In August 1981 the parish priest died and no Macedonian-Bulgarian priest
        could be provided by the Russian Church in Exile. In March 1982, the
        parish voted for secession from the Russian Church in Exile. Holy
        Trinity joined the Bulgarian Diocese. A Bulgarian priest, the Very Rev.
        Blagoy Chiflyanov was appointed by The Holy Synod on the request by the
        parish.

        In August 1992, Father Chiflyanov retired and was replaced by the Very
